This lesson focuses on the CESD from the HELP dataset. The code and examples demonstrated in this lesson cover:

* the scoring of the 20 items of the CESD - including the reverse coding of 4 of these items (4,8,12,16)
* reliability (Cronach's alpha) - technically internal consistency - of the 20 items of the CESD
* and factor analysis of these 20 items - related to the internal consistency calculation
